# Experiment 11 : Classes and Objects in C++

## Aim
- To study and implement the use of classes and objects in C++:
  1. Getting values from a user-defined class
  2. Inputting data into a class
  3. Finding the area (length × breadth) of 2 rectangles using classes
  4. Making a calculator program using classes and functions
  5. Getting the volume of a cube after entering side length

## Tools Used
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Classes and Objects in C++
- **Class**: A class is a user-defined data type that groups variables (data members) and functions (member functions) into a single unit.  
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class that allows access to the class members.  

### Key Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and functions together inside a class.  
- **Member Functions**: Functions defined inside a class that operate on its data members.  
- **Access Specifiers**: Define accessibility of members (`public`, `private`, `protected`).

## Algorithm

### 1. Getting Values from a User-Defined Class
1. Start  
2. Define a class with data members  
3. Create member functions to set and get values  
4. Create an object and call these functions  
5. Display the values  

### 2. Inputting Data into a Class
1. Start  
2. Define a class with input member functions  
3. Use `cin` inside the function to get values  
4. Display the stored values through another function  
5. Stop  

### 3. Finding the Area of 2 Rectangles Using Classes
1. Start  
2. Define a `Rectangle` class with length and breadth  
3. Create a function to calculate area  
4. Input length and breadth for two rectangles  
5. Calculate and display their areas  

### 4. Calculator Program Using Classes and Functions
1. Start  
2. Define a class `Calculator` with functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide  
3. Input two numbers  
4. Call respective functions through an object  
5. Display results  

### 5. Finding the Volume of a Cube
1. Start  
2. Define a class `Cube` with side length as data member  
3. Create a function to calculate volume (`side × side × side`)  
4. Input side length  
5. Display the calculated volume

## Functions
- `cin` and `cout` for input and output  
- Member functions inside classes for operations  
- Objects to access class members  
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

## Conclusion
Through this experiment, I learned how to define and use classes and objects in C++. I understood how data members and member functions work together, and how real-world problems like area, volume, and calculator operations can be implemented using classes. This experiment strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts.
